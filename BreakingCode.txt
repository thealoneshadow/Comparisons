Breaking code into multiple files can be helpful in many ways, particularly for larger codebases. Here are some of the main benefits:

Improved organization: Breaking code into multiple files can help you organize your codebase in a logical and coherent way, making it easier to understand and maintain.
You can group related functionality together and separate concerns, such as separating the user interface code from the backend logic.

Easier collaboration: Breaking code into smaller files can make it easier for multiple developers to work on a codebase simultaneously. 
Each developer can work on their own module or file without having to worry about conflicts or stepping on each other's toes.

Modularization: Breaking code into multiple files can help you create reusable code modules that can be shared across different parts of your application. 
This can help reduce duplication of code and make it easier to maintain and update your application over time.

Performance: Breaking code into multiple files can also help with performance. Instead of having one large file that needs to be loaded every time the application runs,
you can load only the necessary files on demand. This can help reduce the initial loading time of your application and improve overall performance.

In general, breaking code into multiple files can be a great way to improve code organization, collaboration, modularization, and performance. However,it's important to 
keep in mind that breaking code into too many files can also create complexity and make it harder to maintain the codebase. 
So, it's important to strike a balance and find a structure that works best for your specific needs.
